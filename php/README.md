### Analysis
We are given a website with a send message and a get message functionality but, unfortunately, not working yet. We can see the source code, but it's pretty useless. 

Let's inspect a little deeper the website, so by accessing the *robots.txt* file we can see two files.

We have *download.txt* and *index.txt*: the same names of the two source codes of the site.. looks promising.

By reading them we clearly see that they have some more interesting code, and in particular the download.txt file has what we are looking for.
