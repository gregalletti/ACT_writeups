### Analysis
We are given a binary that, after an analysis with ```Ghidra``` is clear that is a random number generator. It gives us a random number as output and we have to guess the seed.

A nice way to solve it is to rewrite it it Python and then run it with symbolic variables (we will use claripy for this).
